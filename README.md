This is a TI-84 Plus CE clone of the popular game Age of Empires 2, written in Assembly.

## Build
To build AoCE, grab [ConvPNG](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/convpng/releases), [ConvHEX](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/convhex/releases) and [spasm](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng/releases). Put `ConvHEX` and `spasm` in the main folder and `convpng` in the `gfx/` folder. After that, run `make gfx` from the command line to build the graphics, and then `make` to build AoCE.

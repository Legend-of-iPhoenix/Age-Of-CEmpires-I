# Age of CEmpires I
This is a TI-84 Plus CE clone of the popular game Age of Empires 2

## Build
You can build AoCE.8xp yourself, if you want to mess around with graphics and/or code.
It's not really difficult, unless you want to change graphics. 

### Change graphics
In the folder you changed it, convert the images using ConvPNG. It will create a certain .inc file, which includes all the graphics.
However, since the graphics are not in the main folder, add "gfx/_folder_/" to all the includes. Also, please remove the include to the palette, you don't need it.

### Compile
To compile and build it all, be sure you have the latest version of spasm and ConvHex, and put them both in the tools folder.
Now doubleclick the build.bat file, and it will compile it!

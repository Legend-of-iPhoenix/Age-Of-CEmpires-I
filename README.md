This is a TI-84 Plus CE clone of the popular game Age of Empires 2, written in Assembly.

## Build
To build AoCE, grab [ConvPNG](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/convpng), [ConvHEX](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/convhex) and [spasm](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng). Put `ConvHEX` and `spasm` in the main folder and `convpng` in the `gfx/` folder. After that, just run `build.bat` to convert all the graphics and build AoCE from the source.

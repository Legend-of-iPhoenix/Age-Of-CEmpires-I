This is a TI-84 Plus CE clone of the popular game Age of Empires 2, written in Assembly.

## Build
Just run build.bat, or open the command line and type `build` followed by an enter.

### Change graphics
Just change graphics to whatever you want, and doubleclick the `build_graphics.bat` file. If everything went right (so ConvPNG doesn't crash 1 or more times), you can compile the main program.

### Compile
To compile and build it all, be sure you have the latest version of spasm and ConvHex, and put them both in the tools folder.
Now doubleclick the `build.bat` file, and it will compile it!
